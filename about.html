                <p>This app uses Google Maps to geolocate two addresses given by the user and then calculates a midpoint between
                    the two locations using the Google Maps API. It then reverse geolocates the calculated midpoint and sends
                    the city name of the midpoint to the GeoNames API to obtain a list of cities with populations over 15,000
                    people within a 300km radius from that midpoint. Next, we filter the cities and store those with a population
                    of over 100,000 people. The stored values are ordered from largest city to smallest city and the top
                    3 cities are populated on the Google Map and presented to the user in the trip table. These cities are
                    then taken by the Kiwi API which calculates the total price for users to fly to each potential destination
                    city, and displays these prices to the user. In some cases, the search will not display 3 cities because
                    there were not enough major cities within that midpoint. The users will be prompted with a modal explaining
                    that 3 large cities were not found and present the number of cities that were.</p>
